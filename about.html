        <h1>Escape From Tarkov</h1>
        <p>
            From the official wiki, "Escape from Tarkov is a hardcore and realistic online first-person action RPG with MMO features." 
            While it has RPG and MMO elements, EFT is a love letter to military sims like ARMA or Operation Flashpoint. 
            Battlestate Games, headquartered in St. Petersberg, Russia, developed EFT as their first game. 
            Tarkov is a fictional city located in the equally fictional region of Norvinsk. Norvinsk is set in Russia, near the border with Europe. 
            After a long period of war, you play as either Russian or European special forces trying to escape from the near-apocalyptic environment.
        </p>

        <h1>The Hideout</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The Hideout is a feature first launched in late 2019. While it's listed as a "location", and you can technically walk around 
            it in first-person, it's not like other maps. The hideout is a bombed out old shelter, containing a number of stations that 
            allow for crafting, give benefits over time, etc. In a nutshell, upgrading your hideout makes you more powerful and resiliant 
            in the main game.
        </p>
        <h2>Stations</h2>
        <h3>Crafting Stations</h3>
        <p>
            The crafting stations include the <b>workbench</b>, the <b>lavatory</b>, <b>medstation</b>, and the <b>nutrition unit</b>. 
            New player tip - items crafted in the hideout count as being "found in raid." This can be helpful when you need specific items 
            for quests. While most of the stations are self-explanitory (medstation makes meds, workbench weapons, etc) the lavatory isn't 
            as obvious. The lavatory produces (as of patch 0.12.x) two useful things - a <a href="https://escapefromtarkov.gamepedia.com/Magazine_case">magazine case</a> 
            and (full) <a href="https://escapefromtarkov.gamepedia.com/Expeditionary_fuel_tank">fuel tank</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Passive Stations</h3>
        <p>
            Passive stations provide passive benefits like energy or health regeneration. The passive stations are the <b>air filtering unit</b>, 
            <b>heating system</b>, <b>intelligence center</b>, <b>library</b>, <b>rest space</b>, and <b>water collector</b>. All of these provide either 
            a health/energy/hydration percent bonus or a boost to skills. Passive stations are some of the earliest (heating, water) and latest 
            (library, air filtering) stations that you can build. Another tip for new players - some of the earliest gates you'll face are hydration and 
            health (as you die a lot early). The water collector and medstations are cheap investments that can keep you playing the main game without paying 
            huge amounts of money.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's important to note that the bonuses from your hideout only apply to your main character, aka your PMC. Scavs, other than getting 
            a reduced cooldown, obviously don't get any benefit from the hideout.
        </p>
        <h3>Other Stations</h3>
        <p>
            The remaining stations either provide items on a regular basis (free money!) or serve as pre-requisites to building and upgrading. 
            They're pretty easy to understand, so we won't go over them much, but one second-order effect to consider is how they affect 
            item prices. One classic high-ticket item found in raids, the <a href="https://escapefromtarkov.gamepedia.com/Graphics_card">graphics card</a>, 
            is used to power the <a href="https://escapefromtarkov.gamepedia.com/Hideout#Bitcoin_Farm">Bitcoin farm</a>, which makes money over time. 
            As patches come out and changes are made to the hideout, it's worth considering how that will affect item prices on the black market.
        </p>
